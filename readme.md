SSL-EY: Maximizing Correlation in Self-Supervised Learning
===========================================================

This repository hosts the official PyTorch implementation of SSL-EY (Self-Supervised Learning with an Eckhart-Young characterization), as detailed in the paper SSL-EY: Self-Supervised Learning with Eckhart-Young Characterization by James Chapman and Lennie Wells, presented at NeurIPS 2023 Workshop: Self-Supervised Learning - Theory and Practice.

Public Benchmarks
--------------------

Our loss function plugs into public SSL software pipelines and all of the results in the paper were produced from our public fork of solo-learn.
